# Machine Learning

- Definition

  A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## Supervised Learning

- Definition

  In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output. 

- Categorized(Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems)

  - In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function.
  - In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.

## Unsupervised Learning

- Definition

  Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

- Example

  Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.

## Model and Cost Function

### Model Representation

- Notation

  -  x^(i) :  “input” variables

  - y^(i) : “output” variables or target variable

  - m : called a training set

  - h : called a hypothesis
